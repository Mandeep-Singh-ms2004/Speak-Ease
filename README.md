AI-Powered Accessibility Communication Platform
Overview

The AI-Powered Accessibility Communication Platform is a mobile application designed to enable seamless communication for individuals with speech and hearing impairments. The system integrates Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, Sign Language Recognition, Automatic Language Detection, Real-Time Translation, and Location-Based Language Suggestions to create an inclusive and intelligent communication experience.

This project aims to reduce communication barriers and promote digital accessibility using modern AI and mobile technologies.

Problem Statement

Individuals who are deaf, mute, or speech-impaired often face communication challenges in daily interactions. Language differences further increase these barriers. There is a need for a unified, AI-powered platform that enables real-time, multi-language communication in a simple, accessible, and user-friendly manner.
