Problem Statement

Individuals who are deaf, non-verbal, or speech-impaired face significant challenges when interacting with others in daily life. Traditional communication methods such as written text, basic text-to-speech apps, or manual typing can often be slow, limited in language support, and not suitable for real-time interaction. There is a need for a unified, intelligent platform that supports dynamic two-way communication across multiple languages and user contexts.
